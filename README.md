# The-Howling-Kitty-BETA
A mini batch game a made in my free hours. It's my experimental story type game! =3

Hi mewp! So this is a MS-DOS game =3
It won't work if u donut haz cmd!

Instructions:
 
 Run the: The Howling Kitty.bat

 As u can see this is a typing choice based game owo
 you should follow the (choice1/choice2) & remove the _ if your going
 to type!

 DO NOT just enter a blank choice! It will "Crash" the cmd &
 so your progress will be gone =<
 (Still figuring out how to fix this)

Keys:

 enter - next line
 
Coding:

 You can check out how I did this by doing right-click
 on the .bat files =3

 (ik a bitt of coding x3 I was just busy derping owo
 also i know a bit already how to make simple batch commands
 so =3 but I still need to tweak the game -w- also learning
 more for more power & expertise OwO)
